# Learning Plan

Feeling like you need a little bit of a refresh when it comes to the Academy material? Here is a short list of exercises that are made to sharpen your skills and make sure you are up to date and on your best game.

## Tips

- One assessment at a time, make sure to finish one before moving to the next, because it can be quite overwhelming

- Try to focus on one topic at a time, this will make sure you don't have too much on your plate. Example: first complete the React exercise, then the React & Redux.

- Feeling stuck? Take a break, do something else. Still stuck? Reach out to someone
